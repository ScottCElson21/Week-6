The Rangers\u2019\nmononror tTiwinh _\nmost but even he has his troubles. For the\nmanager of an ice-hockey team is probably\nthe only coach in sports who can\u2019t tell his\nplayers how to perform. He knows what they\nshould do and he can sense what they might do.\nBut a high-speed hockey game just doesn\u2019t\ngive him time to say how or when to do it.\nDespite the harassment# of his job,\nBoucher remains an amiable and philo\nsophic gentleman. He left the Royal Cana\ndian Mounted Police 26 years ago to become a\nhockey pro and he knows what to expect.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to plan your game\nfrom the sidelines,\u2019\u2019 he says. \"A hockey player\nhas a woman\u2019s prerogative: he can change his\nmind as often as he likes. He can go anywhere\non the rink that he thinks offers him a soorin\nchance. All I can do is hope that he\u2019s right -\nand that he gets there fast.\u201d\nOf course, Boucher can influence the gam\nby rotating his players skillfully, by spottin\ntechnical errors for them to correct or by notin\nopponents\u2019 weaknesses for them to exploi\nBut the course and conduct of the game is i\nthe hands of the 15 free-thinking individua\nwho make up the Ranger squad.\nIt follows that Boucher can avoid a numbc\nof headaches during the National Hocke\nLeague season by picking his players carefull\nat the Rangers\u2019 training camp in the fall.

There are n\ncalisthenics, no obstacle courses, no series c\nplays to run through. Hockey people belie\\\nthat skating is the best unlimbering exercis\nand that scrimmages are the best conditioner\nIn making his choices, Boucher relies prett\nheavily on his own observation of a player\nabilities.

Lindsay,\na cocky little sprout of 23, is the best left\nthe majority of hockey players shoot from\nthe left side, and the most sensible of them\ncan\u2019t give you a sensible reason for it.\nTed\u2019s job as a left wing is to score goals\nand to keep the enemy right wing, who plays\nopposite him, from scoring. Anything else\nhe does is pretty much his own idea. A\nclassic example of embroidering on the\nbasic pattern was the game in which the\nDetroit people first scouted him.\n\"Ha's fox Us\"\nLindsay was then playing junior hockey\naround Toronto. His team invaded a\nsmall town near by and lost, 5-3. Lindsay\nscored all his club\u2019s goals, and also engaged\nwing in professional hockey.\nOn a team which has a star at\nevery position, he stands out\nlike a misspelled word in Web\nster\u2019s, and already, hockey men\nare predicting he will take\nhis place with Morenz, Shore,\nBoucher and the rest as a\nhockey immortal.\nSkilled and Rough\nThis is a heady draught of\ngreatness for a youth in his\nfifth year as a pro.

He is also right-handed and\ncan\u2019t explain why he should be a left wing.\nLefties in hockey, as in baseball or golf, get\nthe power into their shots with the left hand.\nAnd proportionally there aren\u2019t any more\nnatural lefties in hockey than elsewhere in\nthe human race.

Hockey means con- '\nstant action from start to finish and the\nplay is always open, so that even the un\ninitiated spectotor can keep track of it at\nall times. i\nTo play it requires not only much\nskill with the hockey stick, but a thor\nough mastery of the art of skating as\nwell. The hockey player must be able\nto accomplish all kinds of quick move\nments, sudden stops and body balancing\non skates as effectively as if he were\nplaying tennis on the turf. Thus it is\nthat falls are few among the crack\nhockey players, and it is seldom that\na serious accident happens in a hockey\nmatch.\nTEAM WORK ESSENTIAL. |\nHockey teams consist of seven play- ;\ners each, their functions being similar\nto those of football or lacrosse players. '\nThere are forwards for offensive work, 1\ncover players for defensive play and\nbacking up and a goal keeper to guard\nthat Important station. The play is es\nsentially team work, although individual\nachievements frequently help along to\nward victory and success. The clubs that\nwin often are those that do the best team\nwork.\nThe game is played on the ice, the\nbone of contention being a hard rubber\npuck, shaped like a two-pound weight, 1\nthree inches in diameter and one inch\nthick. This is propelled with hockey\nsticks of the shape familiar to all who\nplayed \"shinney\" in their boyhood.\nHockey players become so proficient in\nthe use of the stick that they can push\nthe puck along gently, snap it in any\ndirection or lift it the length of the rink\nby different wrist motions, according to\nthe demands of the moment. The object\nof the play is to get the puck through the\nopponents' goal.\nOLD-FASHIONED SHINNEY. J\nIn many respects hockey is the most\nattractive of all the games that have\nbeen developed from the old-fashioned\nn\nV\n-r'\n=1\nP?\n/wm\nJ\n\u2014 =\u00dcL!\nfr\n\u00ef\u00efW\nn\nmmr\nnu?\nUL\u00e0\nrr*m\ni* \u00ea\"\nAWAITING SIGNAL TO START THE HOCKEY MATCH.\n\"shinney.\" The Canadians produced it\nfirst, and it was taken up in short order\nall over that colony. While spasmodic\nattempts have been made at different\ntimes to introduce hockey in American\ncities as much as fifteen years ago. it\nwas not until the winter of 1894-5 that\nany consistent effort was made to show\nAmericans what real hockey was like.\nAt that time the champion team from\ni\u00bb 11\n\u00abSS\n<3;\n3\n%\nV\nii'A\nran\nhim\nUllliuin\nEli./\nc\nFACING OFF.\nKingston, Ont., made a tour of Boston,\nPittsburg and other American cities, giv\ning exhibitions that aroused public in\nterest and resulted in the establishment\nof hockey teams in those cities.\nNew York had no ice skating rink at\nthe time, and could not, therefore, ac\ncommodate the Canadians. But it was\nin New York that the first regular\nhockey club was organized. About a\nscore of young Canadian-born residents\nestablished the Hockey club of New York\nin December, 1895, setting an example\nwhich has been followed in nearly all the\nlarger eastern cities of the United States.\nThe Shamrock and Montreal Athletic as\nsociation teams visited New York that\nwinter, and helped the game along by\ngiving clever exhibtions.\nRAPID DEVELOPMENT.\nAbout the only American dub the\nHockey club of New York could find\nthat winter to compete with was the\nBaltimore Hockey club. The following\nwinter the big athletic clubs and the col\nleges took the game up with such success\nthat it is now a part of the regular sport\ning curriculum of those institutions. The\nNew York Athletic club gathered in the\nbest seven players of the Hockey club,\nnot an unusual proceeding for the Mer\ncury Foot ; the Knickerbockers developed\na team from among its own skaters, and\nother teams were organized by clubs In\nNew York, Brooklyn, Montclair, Philadel\nphia, Boston and Pittsburg. Several\nof these banded themselves together\nand founded the Amateur Hockey\nleague of America, which is destined to\nbecome one of the most important of\nnational sporting bodies.\nThe Hockey league conducts a cham-\npionship tournament each winter, the\nwinner of which is open to challenge from\nany representative team in the country\nno$ associated with the league. The\nchampionship games are contested with\nall the yim, daring and determination\nthat mark the -big college football games.\nThe spectacular nature of the field and\nits surroundings make the matches ideal\nentertainment for the average American.\nThe game is played in two halves, each\nlasting- 20 minutes, with an interval of\n10 minutes between the halves. A referee\nand two goal umpires are the only olli-\ncials.\n- .BUSY LITT! E PUCK.\nThe puck is faced by one player of j\neither sale in the center of the field, be- |\ntween two goals, when the game begins.\nAt the signal of the referee the puck is !\npushed either one way or the other and j\nthe scramble is on. All over the ice the\nlittle puck slides with confusing rapidity,\nwith from four to twelve players fighting\nfor a crack at it. Sometimes, when the\nplayer has a clear field, with good inter\nference, he will dribble the puck a dis\ntance of fifty feet or more, one of the\nprettiest feats of the game. To dribble\nis to push the puck along by a steady\npressure of the flange of the hockey stick,\nocacsionally jerking it this side and that,\nto avoid the stick of an opposing player.\nAnother effective play is to lift the\npuck clear of the ice and send it spinning\nthrough the air, often the entire length\nof the rink. Tt requires a special knack\nto do that successfully, and only a few\nof the players can accomplish the trick\nproperly.\nAgility and quickness are required of\nall the players at all times. The con\ntest is one continuous series of quick\nplays, which keep the boys on the jump\nfor the chances as well as for their bodily\nprotection. Rough play is not permitted,\nbut there are times when body checking\nbecomes more than a polite request to\nease up. In body checking one player\ngives bis opponent the shoulder in order\nto retard his progress. When the men\narc skating fast in opposite directions the\nbody check is apt to be more forceful than\ngood manners should justify.\nGOALKEEPER'S PRIVILEGES.\nThc> goalkeeper is one of the most\nimportant players of the team. It is his\nfunction to guard the goal and keep the\npuck from passing between the two flag\ntopped goal posts. He alone may use his\nharids in stopping the puck, according to\nCanadian rules. American rules do not\ncover that point, and other phi y ers fre\nquently avail themselves of the opportu\nnity to block with their hands. The goal\nkeeper has other minor privileges, made\nnecessary by the demands of his position.\nThe trams entered in the race of the\nAmateur Hockey league this year are\nthose of the Hockey club of New York,\nNew York Athletic club, Montclair\nAthletic club, Brooklyn Skating club\nand St. Nicholas Skating club. The\nHockey club, pioneers of the sport in the\nUnited States, have developed another\n; good t am. captained by Samuel M. Phil\nlips, with E. J. O'Donnell as goalkeeper.\nHAIR RISES ON END.\nAn eminent medical man, whose trea\ntises on human hair have attracted much\nnotice, among many other striking\nstew tia-nts as to woman's chief beauty,\nremarked that \"bristling\" when used in\nspeaking of the human hair, is not a fig\nure. The hair is subject to and influ\nenced by almost every passion of the hu\nman mind, and emotional hair, of which\nhe lias treated especially, he claims is\nquite commmi. Hair looks, feels and falls\ndifferently when a person is in sorrow, joy\nsurprise or dejection. After a day or two\nof deep mental study or violent bodily\nexerciS'-. a most visible difference may be\ndetected by a practical observer. The\nday is fated to come, he maintains, when\nthis coloring in the hair will be a valua\nble aid in identification.\nWORN-OUT ARMY' UNIFORMS.\nKngland gets $150,000 a year from the\nworn-out uniforms of its army*\n'\nj\nSociety\nWomen\nand.in fact,nearly all\nwomen who undergo\na neTvous stTAin. are\ncompelled to regret\nfully watch the grow\ning pallor of their\ncheeks, the coming\nwrinkles and thinness\nthat become more\n''distressing every day.\nEvery woman\nknows that ill-health\nis a fatal enemy to\nbeauty and that good\nhealth gives to the\nplainest face an en\nduring attractiveness.\nPure blood and strong\nnerves \u2014 these are the\nsecret of health and\n/\nV\n-.V\nV\nV*\nbeauty.\nDt.

Toronto\u2019s defense men\nwere hitting us with vigor \u2014 and they were\nhulking fellows.\nWe had to win this game to keep in the\nrace for the 1937 Stanley Cup playoffs, and\nthings looked black. The Toronto Leafs al\nready had two goals and Buzz Boll, Syll Apps\nand Harvey Jackson were skating like furies,\ndetermined to protect that lead.\nMy Rangers' only chance of overhauling\nthe Leafs lay in our first line. Frank Boucher,\n- the clever veteran, centered that first line of\nours, and on one wing he had Cecil Dillon,\nwho can really fly on steel. A redheaded young\nster playing his first season on the top line was\nat left wing.\nSuddenly Dillon saw his opening. A shim\nmering ribbon of shaved ice squirted off his\nblades as he suddenly shifted and swooped\nacross the mouth of the Toronto net. He\nfeinted Walter Broada out \u2014 and there was a\ntell-tale bulge in the netting as Dillon\u2019s shot\nfound its mark.\nAgain, a few minutes later, raven-haired\nDillon outskated his checker, deftly fondled a\npass on the end of his stick, and beat the\nToronto goaler. The pass? Oh, it had been\nshuttled in by Boucher ... or maybe it was\nthat redheaded kid. The kid did seem to be in\non every play, at that . . . There was Dillon\n& loose again! For the third time his shot lit that\ntell-tale red bulb.\nWe won that game, 5 to 3, and I felt pretty\nfine about it as I left the dressing room. In the\n\u201d passage I met King Clancy, veteran Toronto\ndefense man, and Conny Smythe, his boss.\nSmythe asked:\n\u201cI suppose you think Cecil Dillon was the\nbest man on your club tonight?\"\nWell, I did, and I said so. After all, Dillon\nhad banged in three goals!\n\u201cThat shows,\u201d snorted Smythe, \u201chow much\nyou know about it. You can have Dillon,\n. Lester. I\u2019ll take that kid of yours \u2014 for $10,\n000. He was tops tonight. Didn\u2019t you see who\nset up the plays for those goals that Dillon\nmade?\u201d\nYes, it had been my own flesh and blood \u2014\n24-year-old Lynn Patrick \u2014 skating out there\non the first line with Boucher and Dillon. And\nas Smythe made his offer I felt a twinge of\nguilt. I realized I had been leaning backward\ntoo far, trying not to favor my son.\nIf I had needed any additional proof after\n, Smythe waved that $10,000 offer in my face,\nit came a few weeks later.\nWe were in a tight spot with Les Canadiens\nof Montreal. The Flying Frenchmen were\nleading the league when they came into Madi\nson Square Garden that February night last\nwinter. Moreover, they had us down, two\ngoals to none, with eight minutes left to play.\nThen it happened. Lynn streaked straight\ndown the middle, splitting the Canucks\u2019 de\nfense, took a pass from Joe Cooper at the goal\nmouth and beat Hainsworth in the nets with a\npretty feint and shot.\nAfter that the Canadiens watched him\nevery moment, hounding him, jostling him.\nBut somehow, Lynn tore loose again. He\nstickhandled his way through brilliantly,\nhurdling enemy sticks which were hooked out\nin a desperate effort to halt his wild tour.\nFinally he was in there again, eye-to-eye with\nthe goaltender. There were just sixty-three\nseconds left to play when he shot that tying\ngoal. We won in overtime, 5 to 3. Lynn Patrick\nhad come a long way since his debut in pro\nfessional hockey.\nLynn had been pretty terrible when he first\ndonned a Ranger suit back in the 1934-1935\nseason.\n1 can hear it now, as it rolled down from\nthe top balcony of Madison Square Garden \u2014\nthat insistent demand, chanted over and over.\n\"Take him out! We want Somers?\u201d\nThat cry stabbed me \u2014 hard. My team,\nwith some of its old stars fading fast, seemed\nto be floundering. The fans were impatient,\nangry. Wise in the ways of hockey, they kept\nup that chant: \u201cWe want Somers!\u201d\nNow Artie Somers, squatting there on the\nRanger bench beside me, could have done a\nmuch better job playing center on our third\nline than that redheaded youngster of mine.\nI knew he was no star, believe me. And\nnewspapermen whose colorful stories had\ncalled me a hockey wizard, \u201cthe Gray Fox of\nthe Rinks,\u201d felt that I knew it.\nBut I had made up my mind I was going to\nsee the redheaded kid through. Lynn, you see,\nhad always had visions of being a big star, but\nI had always told him that he never had a\nchance in hockey, that he wasn\u2019t made for the\ngame.\nLynn was bom and brought up in Victoria,\ncapital city of British Columbia, where the\nweather is so mild that often the entire winter\npasses without a single day of outdoor skating.\nWhile lads in other parts of the Dominion\npractically teethed on their hockey sticks,\nLynn played other games. He did have some\nhockey at the indoor rink in Victoria \u2014 but\nin 1929 the rink burned down. Lynn was 17\nthen \u2014 and heartbroken.\nWhen I inaugurated my hockey school in\nOctober, 1934, Lynn begged me for a chance\nto attend. I let him come, but told him out\nright that he didn\u2019t have a chance. Then\nBoucher and Cook batted in. They tokl me\nin front of Lynn that they thought I was\nwrong \u2014 that he had possibilities!\nThe boy was overjoyed. I, of course, was\nfurious. However, as a result of this interfer\nence by Boucher and Cook, Lynn jumped onto\nthe Rangers, without any professional ex\nperience \u2014 an unheard-of thing.\nAlmost untO it dawned on me that he was a\n\u2019\u2019find\u201d for the Rangers I was hoping Lynn\nwould turn to something surer, safer and saner\nfor a living. Having taken many a thumping\nand gone down where my nose, ears and eyes\nwere hobnobbing with some defense man\u2019s\nrazor-sharp blades, I knew well that hockey\nis never safe, and not always sane.\nThe 1935-36 season was the first year in\nRanger history that we missed the Stanley\nCup playoffs, but Lynn\u2019s rise to stardom was\nsome balm for the break-up of hockey\u2019s great\nest forward line \u2014 Bill and Bunny Cook and\n. Frank Boucher.\nLast year I profited handsomely by the\nbrilliant play of my son. He shot .many vital\ngoals in the amazing march of a team that was\na 50 to 1 shot to get into the Stanley Cup\nfinals, after finishing last the year before.\nAs far as Lynn\u2019s case goes \u2014 and I insist\nthat any big-city lad has as much chance as\nhe had to make the Rangers, as far as oppor\ntunities and experience are concerned \u2014 won\nders never cease. His brilliant work did not\nend with the regular season; under the stress\nand strain of Stanley Cup play he continued\nto climb to real stardom.\nIn our first game in the playoffs, against\nToronto, the Leafs were favored to snuff us\nright out of the running. The play was fast,\nhard and scoreless for 55 minutes. Then Lynn\ncrashed through to notch our first goal \u2014 the\nopening wedge for a victory that was to bring\nus also into a conquest of the highly-favored\nMontreal Maroons and smackbang into the\ndefending champions, the mighty Red Wings\nof Detroit.\nYou can imagine how I felt as Lynn pounded\nin two goals in our first tiff with the Red\nWings, to lead the way in an upset 5 to 1 vic\ntory over the champions. That, for me, was\nthe climax of a very happy year, even though\nthe Rangers didn\u2019t have quite enough left to\ncarry on and capture the prized Stanley Cup.\nHockey has held many thrills for me. I have\nbeen in fourteen Stanley Cup finals \u2014 the\nhockey equivalent of baseball\u2019s World Series\n\u2014 in my thirty-four years of major-league\nhockey. I\u2019ve seen Broadway take to hockey\nand acclaim my stars.\nBut nothing has given me the flush of satis\nfaction that came with the realization that\nmy bungling but persistent redheaded boy\nhad made the grade to stardom.", "batch": "dlc_1kahlo_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1937-12-05/ed-1/seq-99.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "9"}, {"sequence": 103, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1947-01-26/ed-1/seq-103/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19470126", "title": "Evening star.

Den\nmark, so far, Is the only non-English\nypeaking country in the conference.\nIn light of the growing Interest in\naompetitive sports for women, spurred\nby their dramatic successes at the\nOlympic games this Summer, the\nmatch today is attracting the atten\ntion of both men and women in the\namateur sport world. Although no\nwomen's hockey teams competed for\nWorld supremacy at the 1936 Olympic\ngames, it is thought that this ancient\n\u25a0port\u2014a game that has been played for\nmore than 2,500 years and Is the na\ntional game of India\u2014will be repre\ntented by the feminine sex at the 1940\n\u2022vent.\nThe Englisn gins may sureiy win\ntoday, according to Hazel Sayre, cap\ntain of the District team, but the\nWashington outfit Is displaying pride\nand excitement about defending its\ngoal against the champion Cardinal\neleven. The honor of defeating a crack\nEnglish women's hockey team still re\nmains open to ladies all over the globe,\naccording to Miss Sayre. It has never\nkeen done.\nIn some instances friendships made\nat the two previous conferences of the\nassociation, and when the English field\nhockey team invaded America in 1928.\nare being renewed.

Attendance was\nexcellent at this meeting of many na\ntions, and it was unanimously voted\nto form an association.\nOn account of the great distances\nbetween interested countries\u2014Scot\nland and Australia for an example\u2014\nit was three years before the actual\nmeeting took place, in January, 1927,\nwhen a constitution was accepted and ;\nthe federation became a fact, dedi\ncated \"to further the best interests\nof the game among women of all na\ntions. to promote friendly intercourse\namong players, to work for uniformity\nof rules, and to promote international\nmatches.\"\nThe first conference was held In\nGeneva in 1930, and though no tour\nnament took place at this time, sev\neral exhibition games were played.\nIn 1933 the conference was held In\nDenmark, with all of the present mem\nbership teams competing except South\nAfrica and Australia, as well as visit\ning teams from Germany and Hoi- j\nland, and an \"overseas, etc.\u201d team\nmade up of visiting players not con\nnected with any national team.\nSouth Africa has become a mem\nber since the last conference, and\nis therefore displaying its tournament\nskill for the first time in an alierr.\nland, while, although Australian worn- I\nen hockey players have been members\nsince the federation was bom. they j\nhave never before attended an inter- j\nnational conference.\nHeading the English field hockey\nteam on its first visit here in eight ;\nyears is Miss Mildred K.

As far as the\nUnited States is concerned, the first\nofficial games took place In 1921, when\na team from England came over and\ngave a skillful demonstration of indi\nvidual technique and co-ordinated\nteam play. At that time the visitors\nnot only exhibited, but coached, and\nwere largely responsible for giving\nAmerican hockey new impetus.\nIn 1924 the first American team\nwent overseas and played a series of\nmatches in the British Isles. Against\nthe best English hockey the American\nplayers of that time were helpless, but\nthey gained experience. Between 1924\nand 1933 touring teams from England.\nIreland and Scotland came to the\nUnited States to play against local\nassociations. In the meantime the\ninternational federation had been\nformed, and in 1933 held its first\ntournament in conjunction with its\ntriennial conference in Copenhagen,\nw here it was voted to meet this year\nin America.\nIN THE meantime interest in inter\nsectional competition has been\nspreading rapidly in the United\nStates, according to Miss Pearson.\nHaving originated first along the At\nlantic Seaboard local organizations\nare now moving South, Virginia hav\ning joined the Southeast section of\nthe organization this year.\nSpectators at the National Cathdral\nSchool hockey field this afternoon,\nand those at the matches to be held\nat the Philadelphia Cricket Club,\nChestnut Hills.

Bayh. who\nrecently came here from Terre Haute,\nInJ... to supervise a new system of\nhealth and physical education in the\nWashington schools, and who has in\nteresting plans for a citywide athletic\nprogram.\nHe has definite ideas about adolescent\ngirls and boys and what they need\nin the way of school sport and ath\nletics.\n\u201cIt is a large order,\u201d says Mr. Bayh\n(who incidentally pronounces his\nname as though it were spelled \"by,\u201d\nand who comes by his love for athletics\nnaturally\u2014through a long line of\ngymnasts.) \"It may take several\nyears to complete; but\u2014it can be done\nwith the co-operation of all con\ncerned.\u201d\nAll concerned in this work make\nup a big army\u2014the boys and girls\nthemselves, their parents or guardians,\nthe alumni and alumnae of the high\nschools, and old Johnnie Q. Public.\nWhile the public has a lot to do\nwith any program in the public\nschools, since the public pays the\ntaxes\u2014and pays, and pays and pays\u2014\nl the first persons to please in Mr.\n! Bayh\u2019s estimate are the boys and girls\n\u25a0 involved.\ni After all, they are the primary\n\\ cause for striving after an effect. If\ni what follows does not quite satisfy\nI them, and if they do not enter into\n\u25a0 it with their whole hearts and souls,\n1 the plan will fail.\n> To get an idea of what Mr. Bayh is\ndriving at, you'll have to discount a\nlot of old, outworn theories as they\n\u25a0 pertain to school athletics, hereafter\n! to be known as physical education.\nIn the old days, as almost every\nbody knows, only the high schools\n. ariS colleges really figured in ath\n. letics-*and, then, only a few high\n[ school boys played on the so-called\nvarsity teams.\ns Nor were they always boys. Some\n. times the athletes were old enough to\nhave graduated from college or uni\n\u2019 versKy.\n. TJNDER the new system\u2014when\nr working well\u2014all that will be\n- changed.\n1\nTo begin with, there will be new\nage limit* for the varsity players\u2014on\nsenior or high school teams. This will\nbe brought about gradually. Up to\nthe present time a boy might play on\na team until he Is ready to step into\nman\u2019s estate\u2014at 21 years of age. In\na couple of years that age limit will\nbe knocked down to 19. If there are\nany huskies who fail to graduate and\nthus remain in high school indefinite\nly they will not be permitted to pit\ntheir weight, strength and experience\nagainst adolescent boys.\nOn the basis of a sound mind in a\nsound body, health and physical edu\ncation in the Washington schools will\nhereafter be a sort of prescribed\ncourse advocated for all youngsters\nwith good, stout hearts and sound\nlungs. So that the few at the topi, or\nthe peak of physical perfection, will\nnot get all the benefits as well as the\nglory of competitive games, all boys\nand girls able to run or walk may\ntake an active part in the new ath\nletics.\nThis is going to fake time, for there\nis more to this plan than meets the\neye. It involves a lot of thought and\ndeliberation, study and planning.\nThree great requisites are named\nby Mr. Bayh:\nFirst, facilities\u2014such as base ball\nand foot ball fields, tennis courts,\ncinder tracks, hand ball alleys and\nall that sort of thing.\nSecond, supplies and equipment\nsuch as balls, nets, tennis rackets,\nbats and other paraphernalia.\nThird, leadership\u2014both adult and\npupil.\nTT MIGHT seem a strange situ\nation, but Washington at the mo\nment-even if it is the Nation's Capi\ntal\u2014has not the proper facilities for\na comprehensive health and physical\neducation system in the public schools;\nnor in the private schols, except in\nrare instances.\n, Take the high schools, one by one:\nEastern High is the outstanding\nschool in the city, judged by athletic\nfacilities. There are some 3.000 pupils\nover there, but there are also several\nacres of good playing field\u2014for foot\nball, base ball, track and other sports.\nCentral High, with approximately\n2,800 pupils, is crowded for athletic\nspace.\nWestern High is in fairly good shape\nwith 1.500 pupils and a good-sized i\nstadium several blocks from the main\nplant.\nMcKinley, with 2,400 pupils, has a\ngood ' field\u2014but the school could do\nwith more space\u2014and the Roosevelt\nHigh School\u2014with 2,000 boys and\ngirls\u2014is not so cramped for playing\nquarters, while Woodrow Wilson High,\nwith only a thousand pupils, has yet\nto test its faculties.

If he isn\u2019t\ninjured one night, nor the next,\nnor the next, his apprehension\nmounts, because he knows that\nwhen the crash does arrive, it\u2019ll\nbe a honey. .\nWhy do they do it? Nobody\nknows, themselves least of all.\nsomewhere among the following reasons is\nthe answer:\n1. It\u2019s a good living.\n2. It\u2019s exciting.\n3. Fame and glamor await the stars.\nMost surprising about this roughest of\ngames is the fact that tragedies rarely occur.\nBut near-tragedies \u2014\nOne was curtained from the crowd in the\nearly twenties when Newsy Lalonde, long a\nfactor in big-league hockey, was a pillar of\nplaying strength on the Montreal Canadiens.\nPlaying in his home city, Newsy plunged into\na mass of swirling bodies, flying skates and\nslashing sticks. The puck was free. He could\nsweep-check, grab it and start for \u2014\nHe felt a strange throbbing deep in the\ncalf of his leg. It was too deep and too strange\nto be something ordinary. He stopped, looked\ndown and observed that he was skating on red\nice. Players halted the scramble and picked\nhim up, but that wasn\u2019t enough, as Frank\nPatrick, then the referee, could see.\nFrank plunged two fingers deep into the\nleg wound, and plugged up a deep slash which\nhad severed an artery. They carried Newsy\nfrom the rink and to the hospital with Frank\nPatrick\u2019s fingers still in that leg wound. They\nwere removed only when Newsy was placed\nupon the operating table. Had they come out\nsooner, Lalonde would have bled to death.\nThat slashed leg was an accident, but many\ninjuries are not accidents.\nRabbit McVeigh, who starred with the\nNew York Americans, was the victim in such a\ncase while playing for Regina, Saskatchewan.\nSome one wrapped an ash hockey stick\naround Rabbit\u2019s curly blond head and ren\ndered him senseless all over. Rusty Crawford,\na teammate, appointed himself a committee\nof one to square the account.\nNot many minutes later, as Rabbit lay on\nthe dressing room table, Crawford came in,\nbanned from the game with a major penalty.\n\u201cBoy, did I get him!\u201d Rusty muttered.\n\u201cDid you get that guy!\" his mates echoed\nat the end of the period. \u201cYou took the ear\nright off the side of his head!\u201d\nErnie \"Moose\u201d Johnson, toughest of all\nhockey players, was skating in a western\nCanada mix-up when somebody gave him the\nfull force of a stick against his jaw. The\nreferee sent the offender to the penalty box.\nThen, to the surprise of all beholders, Moose\nDrowtfnf by\nCol* Bradley\n* '\u00bb*\u2022 \u00bbpr.\u00abr<4 ...\nHOT MOMENTS AT THE NET: A DRIVE FOR GOAL THAT FAILED\nstood in the center of the rink, shaking his\nhead and gesticulating wildly. He began to\nskate in circles. Players rushed to him.\nLo and behold, his tongue was jammed up\nagainst his top teeth, solidly impaled. They\nheld his head and pulled the tongue loose\nfrom his top incisors. It was a ghastly bite.\nThey started to escort Moose to the side\nlines, but he fought free.\nBefore they could stop him, Moose skated\nover to the penalty box and whipped his\nstick in a beautiful arc. It connected with the\nnoggin of his assailant and broke both \u2014 the\nstick and the assailant\u2019s noggin.\nNobody ever knew how Moose Johnson\ngot so tough, but tough he was. He had taken\nup hockey after losing three fingers of his\nright hand in a railroad accident \u2014 he had\nbeen a train brakeman. At the age of forty\nfour Moose went back to railroading. The ice\ngame had been a pleasantly rough interlude\nin a colorful life.\nProbably the second toughest player in\nprofessional hockey was Helge Bostrum. He\nwas with the Chicago Black Hawks when he\nmade his celebrated demonstration against\ncomplete incapacitation.\nBill Cook, wing of the New York Rangers,\ncame down and attacked with the puck.\nBostrum, playing defense, sprawled with the\nelusive Cook after a heavy body check. Cook\ngot up, but Helge didn't.\nPlayers picked him up, and his foot dangled\nloosely. They carried Helge to the hospital,\nand said goodby to him, because the doctors\nsaid that the skate slash across the instep\nwould take about 100 stitches \u2014 practically\na career in sewing.\nHelge refused to say goodby to hockey. He\nrested a year and returned to the game.\nChing Johnson, of the New York Rangers,\nhas earned the name of \u201czipper man\u201d because\n5,000 stitches have been put in at one time\nor another to hold his massive framework\ntogether.\nMid-way in the 1931-32 season Ching made\none of his most unfortunate attempts to barge\nthrough a couple of human beings. Usually\nthey gave ground \u2014 or ice \u2014 but this time\nthey met Ching\u2019s charge and spilled with him.\nA few minutes later when he took one of his\ninfrequent rests during a game, he complained\nto Manager Lester Patrick as follows:\n\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with my jaw!\u201d\nHe was more than right. The jaw was\nbroken in three places.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t play again this season,\u201d the\ndoctors confided to Patrick.\nThey wired his jaw three ways, put him\nin a neck harness. And he was back again\nlate in the season.\nThree years ago he broke his leg. Again\nthe doctors pronounced him through, prob\nably for all time. But Ching was bad: before\nlong. He has broken a wrist and collar bone,\ntoo \u2014 almost everything except his spirit.\nBut he continues to play hockey, and, in so\ndoing, he brings business to Madison Square\nGarden and to Polyclinic Hospital across the\nstreet. He is their best customer, and times\nwill be dull around there when Ching stops\ncoming over to be patched up or hemstitched.\nBut down deep, even these so-called tough\nhockey players have their weak momentsv\nLionel Conacher had one in the dressing quar\nters of the Garden. A stick had slashed across\nhis already-battered nose, cutting his eye-lid.\nConacher sat on the rubbing table, clench\ning the edge with white-knuckled fists. His\neyes were closed and he refused to open them\nfor the doctor. They swabbed the blood away\nto see what damage had been done, but they\ncouldn\u2019t be sure as to how far beyond the\nlid the damage went. It was a hole and the\neyeball could have been slashed.\nAnxious seconds passed before the great\nplayer would risk the shock of opening an eye\nfrom which he might not see again. Finally\nthe hands unclenched. The tension left his\nheavyweight frame and he opened his eyes.\nHe could see. The wound was stitched and\npatched and he went out to finish the game.\nBut, you see, these big tough players have\ntheir weak moments!", "batch": "dlc_1johns_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1937-01-17/ed-1/seq-80.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "8"}, {"sequence": 121, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1948-02-29/ed-1/seq-121/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19480229", "title": "Evening star.

Since\nthe introduction of new rules, especially those\nregarding aerial attacks, in the last few years,\nfoot ball has certainly been given winged feet.\nThe introduction of a bit of basket ball into\nthe national Fail pastime tends to lend credence\nto the claims of court enthusiasts that theirs\nIs the fastest sport, to basket ball every muscle\nof the body is continually at work at top speed,\ntwisting, running and throwing.\ngOXINO is a sport which might have a\nbetter claim than the two foregoing.

No small measure of its rapid growth\nas a major Winter sport oaa be attributed to\nIts constant data that It Is the taataat of\n\u2022ports.\nPerhaps the earliest form of hockey generally\nknown in the United States was the game of\n\u201cshinny.- played on the corner lot with a tin\ncan or done and with sticks having a thick\nknob or curve on the end. What few rates\nthere were to this crude sport differed .widely in\nvarious sections. One. however, was widely\nknown and extremely popular with the players\nof the sport. It dealt with the penalty for\noffside play. This penalty was a crack on the\nshins with the opponent's dub. accompanied by\nthe admonition, \u201cShinny on your own side.\"\nThis game was probably a derivation of a\ncruder form of hockey played in Scotland,\nloiown as \u201cshinty.\" A similar game played in\nIreland was called \u201churley.\" Derivation of\nthe present name \"hockey\" is commonly at\ntributed to the French \u201choquet,\" a shepherd\u2019s\ncrook referring to the shape of the stick used\nIn the early stages of the \u2019game Various modi\nfications of the sport were played in Northern\nEurope and Asia.

A\ngroup of fans composed the Men\u2019s Hockey As\nsociation, made a few vital rules and dubbed\nthe resulting game \u201cfield hockey.\" The game\nScoring a goal in a professional ice battle after a previous abet has sent the goalkeeper sprawling, ]\nCapt. * \u2018Hib \u2019 \u2019 Milks of' the Philadelphia\nQuakers Accounts for the Growing\nPopularity of Ice Hockey and Tells Why\nHe Considers It the Most Fiercely\nWaged of Modern Athletic\nEndeavors.\nmay see the game played not only In the universities, colleges and high schoefek\nbut also in the grammar schools throughout the Nation.\nWhat the fan\u2019s opinion of how fast or harsh a sport may be often\nvaries widely with that of the player. The average foot ball coach will\npooh-pooh the charge that present-day foot ball is too rough, claiming\nthat a well trained and hardened player has slight chance for serious\nof field hocked as known In hundreds of girls\u2019\nschools and colleges to a descendant of this\nMen's Hockey Association contest, with the\nrougher features removed. The Wtmbl don\nClub rules, drawn up In IMS. governing the\ngame, which was then played with a hard\nrubber ball and bent sticks, are still effective\naa far as essential points of play are concerned.\nThe sport gained immense popularity in Eng\nland. Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and count\nless international matches were played By\n1907 London alone had 81 teams.\nTwo years before the Wimbledon dub to\nEngland had drawn up a set of rules gov\nerning the game in that section, the first game\nplayed on ice to America took place. The\nVictoria Hockey Club and the McGill Univer\nsity Hockey dub met to Montreal in 1881, and\nthe sport, destined to become one of major\nrank, had its inception in America After this\nclash a code of rules was devised through the\nefforts of the Victoria Club, and the game rap\nidly spread, and to 1884 a general tournament\nwas held, to 1887 the greatest step toward\nconsolidation and clarification of the rules\ngoverning the sport was made with the organ\nization of the Amateur Hockey Association in\nCanada. Since that time the game's growth\nhas been steady. It has crossed the Canadian\nborder, invaded New England and Midwestern\nStates near the boundary line. Perfecting of\nindoor rink equipment further aided Its prog\nress. If experiments with a new type of arti\nficial Ice prove successful, hockey enthusiasts\nInjuries. Therefore, it would seem logical to get the opinion of some\noutstanding player of ioe hockey to see if the players themselves look\nupon the fascinating sport as a fast, fierce game.\nJ-JIB MILKS, versatile and flashy captain of the Quakers, thinks\nloe hockey is not only the speediest sport, but is. in addition,\nthe most furiously fought and fiercest of all athletic combats.\nHibbert Harry Milks has been playing big-time hockey for\n11 seasons. As a boy he played with the Canadian grammar\nschool teams and at 17 had fought his way to the top of the\nyouthful ranks. He was given his first big start with the\nOntario Gunners* Club to 1919. After rounding out his\nexperience with three seasons with that aggregation, he\ninvaded the States. He played on the Pittsburgh Ama\nteur Club In 1922 and then returned to Ottawa, where\nhe joined the ranks of the New Edinburgh Canoe Club\nduring 1923-24. Back to Pittsburgh again with the\nYellow Jackets. Milks continued hte climb to the top.\nHis popularity to PittdHirgh is being duplicated in\nPhiladelphia as pilot of the Quakers.\n\u201cIce hockey is the fastest sport,'\u2019 said Milks;\n\"there is no doubt about it that I can see. Any\none who has played the game knows what\nI mean when I say its speed Is a continuous\n\u2022train. Often a player will be skating at top\nspaed for five minutes at a stretch. Then\n\u2022gain, to the course of a game the player may\ntravel the course of the rink from 100 to 200\ntimes, stopping, starting, turning and twisting.\nWhen you consider how fast even an ordinary\nskater can travel on the let, you realise the\nspeed with which all this to being accom\nplished. You either have to keep up this\nnerve-racking pane or relinquish your post to\na substitute.\n\"I think it to a faster, harder game than\nmodern foot ball, to the first place, ft calls\nfor a quicker brain in analyzing formations\nand plays. In foot ball there are a certain\nnumbv of formations by means of which tho\noffensive to carried on. The team is drilled\nin these formations until each member knows\njust what he is to do In each play. The re\nsult is that each offensive rush Is Just one well\ntimed machlne-like move after another. These\nplays never vary.\n\u201cBut to ice hockey there Is no time tor\nset formations, no time for signals for this or\nthat offensive. When the player finds himself\nwith the puck at the end of his stick and op\nponent* streaking toward him. be has no time\nto call his men back In a huddle and devise\na winning formation. In a split fraction of\na second he must figure out his own offensive\nand execute even as he plans it. Speedy skat\ning and fast stickwork ate essentials of the\ngame, but before these comes quick brain work.\n\u201cNext to a speedy head come swift hands\nand feet to the order of importance. There\nis no use figuring out an offensive charge if\nthe legs can\u2019t carry you swiftly into it, if th\u00ab\nhands can\u2019t guide your stick swiftly through\nto completion.
