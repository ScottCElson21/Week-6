Went back to week 2 work with wget
  Was having trouble finding a suitable data set using the methods we used that week
  tried several from Amalia Skarlatou Levi's twitter thread
  Was interested in the old bailey but felt stonewalled by the site format
    Individual pictures saved as .gif files, and directly beside was an already OCR and cleaned version of the text
 Decided to move on and try to grab a data set from Chronicling America as we did in week 2 with APIs
  Tried a few search tems, came up with some good results for 'hockey'
  Retraced steps of week 2 API discussion, changed search term in the script
  Ran into similar problems as I was having previously with nothing shoing up when I ran the script in command prompt
  Switching to powershell gave desired data, though I was limited to 20 results
    Probably something to do with the 'results per page' limit from the website
    not sure how to get rid of this and access the full 62000 results
    I'm worried that would be overwhelming to parse with my current skillset so I'll stick to 20 for now
  Converted to csv file with online converter
