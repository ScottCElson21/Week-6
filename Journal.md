This week I found myself throwing my arms up in frustration more than in previous weeks
I could feel the despair setting in as I clicked though archival collection upon archival collection
Failing to find an entry point where I could apply some of my knowledge to extract a data set was discouraging
Problems of access are very real
  Not to say that these fonds were impenetrable, but with my current skills and time constraints I was at a loss
Working back to a safer starting point led me down a more productive path than jumping into the deep end did
I chose the keyword of 'Hockey' for my search, hoping to apply my extensive knowledge of the sport and its history
  I felt I would be more comfortable being ruthless with my OpenRefine and REGEX whittling if I were more well versed in the subject matter
  Alas I was never able to tackle the 62000+ entry data set as I could only get the API to grab the first 20 results
  I was forced to limit the scope of my project from there
At times while trimming and manipulating my data I wished I had taken better notes in previous weeks
  Though just as often they came through with enough detail to guide me back to the correct path
As Dr. Graham mentioned to me, this was just one cycle of the process of digital history
  It takes many more cycles to get anything approaching useful or complete
Michelle Moravec had to reconcile the fact that her data set, while large, was not the complete works of her subject's correspondence
  Only 1/3 in truth
  Further highlighting the problem of access and the ways it shapes the types of conclusions we can draw from any particualr data set
